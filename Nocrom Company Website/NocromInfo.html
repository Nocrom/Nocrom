    <div class="information">
        <p>I am Nocrom and this is my introduction. I started out as a YouTuber with the name "PurpleDiamonds1" This came from awhile back when my sister and I were creating a gamer tag on the XBOX 360. We couldn't compromise on one, so my dad suggested we merge the two. The name Nocrom came from when I was working on a ROBLOX game in 2019, when I had to name something, and I decided to name it Nocrom. I then adapted this name & replaced the name Nocrom. Some personal facts is that my birthday is August 6th, I've been playing Minecraft since I was 6 years old, and lastly I've wanted to do YouTube since I was 6. </p>
